It is calculated by dividing the total revenue by the number of active users over a given period. Based on the provided data, we can derive the following insights:

Game C has the highest ARPU at $64.68, indicating that it generates the most revenue per user compared to other games. This could be due to a higher spending pattern among its users, possibly driven by premium content or effective monetization strategies.

Game A follows with an ARPU of $19.58. This suggests a moderate level of user spending, which might be attributed to a balanced mix of free and paid content that encourages user engagement and spending.

Game B has an ARPU of $18.53, slightly lower than Game A. This could imply a similar monetization approach but with slightly less user engagement or spending.

Game D has the lowest ARPU at $13.99, which might indicate a larger user base with lower individual spending or a focus on free-to-play models with limited monetization.

These insights suggest that Game C is the most successful in terms of revenue generation per user, possibly due to effective monetization strategies or a more engaged user base willing to spend more.
